#Interactive Rating Component Using React

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). This is my first time using react on a project and it has been an honor in using assets from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) to create it.

As you can see in the [Github Pages](https://robincredible.github.io/Interactive-Rating-React/) output, this was a pretty simple build. I decided to make it complicated by using a new framework which I had just recently learned to test if I do understand it! Granted, I'm still not that used with the component building and state management/passing props but I was able to pull it off. The code structure and logic can certainly be better, but for now I'll have to settle with it as I also have other projects to do. 

I'll be refactoring this in the near future after getting used a lot more with react!

Feel free to see the code if you can learn anything from it, and I'm very much open for feedback as I am still a rookie with these.

Thanks!
